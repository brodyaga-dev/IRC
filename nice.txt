[147.158.206.247] btw I wonder if I should make a chat archive system
[60.53.35.116] no
[60.53.35.116] or else school will know what we're saying
[147.158.206.247] keep it anonymous right
[60.53.35.10] wait, why would school know what we're saying HERE?
[60.53.35.116] if archive got discovered by school
[147.158.206.247] maybe we can encrypt the archive
[147.158.206.247] in some way
[147.158.206.247] some cipher algorithm
[147.158.206.247] and need a key to decipher it
[147.158.206.247] there are enless posibility
[60.53.35.116] anyways ***247 do you want to pull up yourself on your mcs committee?
[147.158.206.247] alr
[147.158.206.247] now waiting for polling
[60.53.35.116] *** want to sponsor you

[60.53.35.116] my input system keeps eating the words
[60.53.35.116] btw I like this theme
[60.53.35.116] black and green theme
[60.53.35.116] sss
[147.158.206.247] if I become 研教 I promise the 会课 won't be boring anymore
[60.53.35.10] makes me fell like a hacker
[147.158.206.247] yup minimalistic ultra pro max plus special edition +
[147.158.206.247] absolutely
[60.53.35.116] ***247: Today we will gonna learning about how to build a react app
[147.158.206.247] lmao I think all the member will most likely die
[60.53.35.10] I afraid our MCS members can't withstand it
[60.53.35.10] ya
[60.53.35.116] maybe teach them how to use a computer like a nerd
[147.158.206.247] there are lots of interesting tech topic out there, I'm gonna learn and research while teaching
[147.158.206.247] this will be an amazing opportunity for me to learn cool stuff
[60.53.35.116] mcs non-willing members also a lot if I not (I mean 混吃的人)
[60.53.35.116] *if I not wrong
[60.53.35.10] yeah what ************116 says is true
[147.158.206.247] yup I won't allow these kind of people
[60.53.35.116] our society: those groups who have low performance marks go gardening
[147.158.206.247] if they don't listen to the class they will surely die when doing the work I give them
[60.53.35.10] 一个人他可以不厉害，但是他一定要有一个肯学习的心态
[147.158.206.247] ABSOLUTELY
[60.53.35.10] 混吃等死的必死无疑
[147.158.206.247] this is purely a matter of 态度
[60.53.35.116] but admittedly got a lot of person just want the curriculum points
[60.53.35.116] which I think they're wasting their entire Saturday life
[60.53.35.10] sad truth
[147.158.206.247] if they 混吃 then their curriculum points will also be really low
[147.158.206.247] no adventage for them at all
[60.53.35.116] btw ****10 mcs have which section
[60.53.35.10] wdym "which section"?
[60.53.35.116] my society is: art, edu, RS (recreational section), and also commitee
[60.53.35.10] u mean 工作组and学习组？
[60.53.35.116] yup
[147.158.206.247] 学习组 got web, maker, CG, blender and app
[60.53.35.10] 工作组 I have, but in picture format
[60.53.35.10] 工作组 have 资料组 总务组 快讯组 and 康乐组
[147.158.206.247] yup
[147.158.206.247] I HATE 康乐
[60.53.35.10] a little bit boring and 尴尬
[60.53.35.116] your society edu section is quite massive
[147.158.206.247] yup because you know... we learn tech stuff
[60.53.35.116] yup
[60.53.35.10] yeah massive, but I afraid that one day, the leaders of these 学习组 will graduate
[60.53.35.116] then this is why all members MUST learn the workflow of leaders
[60.53.35.10] if no new leaders is present, then the 学习组 will cease to exist
[60.53.35.116] this is VERY IMPORTANT
[147.158.206.247] I'm afraid after I graduate there will be no suitable people to take over my job
[60.53.35.10] ya indeed
[147.158.206.247] of maybe... no one even want to join our group
[60.53.35.116] then ask school if want to hire you as computer teacher
[147.158.206.247] welp after graduated from university maybe can consider
[147.158.206.247] app group is currently in a dangerous position
[60.53.35.116] requires someone to make it continue
[60.53.35.10] I have a crazy idea
[60.53.35.116] say it out
[147.158.206.247] yup
[60.53.35.116] this chat "won't" be recorded
[60.53.35.10] is it possible for leaders to record what they teach into a video?
[147.158.206.247] yup that's what I did
[60.53.35.116] yes
[60.53.35.116] film it as a youtube video
[60.53.35.116] and the future can watch it as reference
[60.53.35.116] *in future
[60.53.35.10] like I can 浓缩 what I have learnt into a chapter and topic based youtube playlist
[60.53.35.10] but that requires lots of time and effort
[147.158.206.247] yup indeed
[147.158.206.247] need to take a lot of time and effort to record and edit
[60.53.35.116] by migrating a topic to digital format it requires a lot of time and effort
[147.158.206.247] especially now our app group has migrated to fullstack development
[147.158.206.247] web dev + mobile dev
[60.53.35.10] btw *************247, if u really become 研教, do u think u still have time to teach app grp member and the whole MCS member?
[147.158.206.247] of course
[147.158.206.247] our MRGA (app group) class is on weekend afternoon
[147.158.206.247] there will not be any conflict between them
[60.53.35.116] and our MCCGA is at night session
[147.158.206.247] yup
[60.53.35.116] so for ****247 it won't be any conflict
[60.53.35.10] impressive......
[147.158.206.247] yup now my life is completely filled up with code and school work
[147.158.206.247] btw I wonder what else features I can implement into this chat app
[147.158.206.247] any idea?
[147.158.206.247] maybe make a mobile app as well :)
[60.53.35.10] whoa
[60.53.35.10] 惊险
[60.53.35.116] whoa
[60.53.35.116] close call
[147.158.206.247] what happened
[60.53.35.116] ****10 got nominated my english teacher
[147.158.206.247] whoa
[147.158.206.247] 刺激
[60.53.35.116] maybe new function like attachment?
[147.158.206.247] that would be cool
[60.53.35.10] being able to send img files?
[147.158.206.247] yup I'll implement it later after school
[147.158.206.247] you guys can stay here and watch the website being updated
[147.158.206.247] anything else?
[60.53.35.10] erm just curious, who else know about this secret chat session?
[147.158.206.247] only us
[60.53.35.10] wow~
[60.53.35.116] those who joined only know
[147.158.206.247] see the ip address in your url box? only us know this
[147.158.206.247] unless someone share it publically
[147.158.206.247] if so I'll need to restart my router to rotate my ip
[60.53.35.10] OH.........
[60.53.35.116] me and ****10 has the similar IP, so I think we use the same fiber line
[60.53.35.10] Joined the chat
[60.53.35.116] ****10 where is your address?
[147.158.206.247] ohh later I need to make the disconnect message
[60.53.35.116] what
[60.53.35.116] ohh
[60.53.35.10] what address?
[147.158.206.247] home address you mean?
[60.53.35.116] postcode only
[60.53.35.10] 81100
[147.158.206.247] me too
[60.53.35.116] im the one who same as school
[147.158.206.247] maybe it's because of the ISP?
[60.53.35.116] i think so
[60.53.35.116] ****247 you also use unifi?
[147.158.206.247] wait ahh I check
[147.158.206.247] https://en.fiberhome.com/default.aspx
[147.158.206.247] this one
[60.53.35.116] I mean your isp
[60.53.35.116] unifi, time, maxis, or others?
[147.158.206.247] should be unifi one as well
[60.53.35.116] i go look up your address
[147.158.206.247] no prob
[60.53.35.116] yup
[60.53.35.116] ISP: Telekom Malaysia Berhad
[147.158.206.247] unifi
[60.53.35.116] I think the ip is fixed when we ionstalled the fiber
[60.53.35.116] it wont run too far from the original one
[147.158.206.247] I believe nowadays malaysia internet market is being monopolied by telekom malaysia
[60.53.35.116] and the ytl
[147.158.206.247] this one? https://www.ytl.com/
[60.53.35.116] yup
[147.158.206.247] too difficult for foreign company to get in
[60.53.35.116] there's some new fiber company like digi, maxis, time and so on
[60.53.35.116] but they still cannot fight the strength of tm
[147.158.206.247] indeed
[147.158.206.247] which is pathetic
[147.158.206.247] ********10 still here?
[60.53.35.116] maybe alr gone
[147.158.206.247] now still unable to see who disconnect

[147.158.206.247] UGLY LIKE SHIT
[60.53.35.116] i think ****10 don't know that this site have the hot reload function
[60.53.35.116] which is mean when ****247 make a commit, the update wiill be automatically applied
[147.158.206.247] yup

[60.53.35.116] im gonna leave
[60.53.35.10] yeah im still here
[147.158.206.247] nice
[60.53.35.10] thinking about virtualisation and emulation
[60.53.35.10] u say both of them are like running smth in the virtual space
[60.53.35.116] I go take a break first so that later I have energy to continue my biology and chemistry class
[147.158.206.247] ohh sure
[147.158.206.247] should be really stress
[147.158.206.247] when you guys will be free again?
[147.158.206.247] hello
[147.158.206.247] anyone?
[60.53.35.10] erm for me, my class ends at 440
[147.158.206.247] ohh today science stream got extra class
[60.53.35.116] later need to help ****10 to make his tomorrow lesson (maybe)
[147.158.206.247] ohh isn't that realshadow's work?
[60.53.35.10] but after 5pm, I dont have much time left
[147.158.206.247] sad
[60.53.35.116] okay i'm gonna just sleep on my desk, and later start my lesson
[147.158.206.247] good luck guys
[147.158.206.247] see ya later
[60.53.35.10] usually is realshadow's work, but tmr I decided to teach them HOW TO DEBLOAT UR PC
[147.158.206.247] maybe teach about how to debloat mac as well
[147.158.206.247] I need it
[147.158.206.247] desparately
[60.53.35.10] i dont think most of our members know about debloating windows
[147.158.206.247] indeed
[60.53.35.10] for MACOS, sadly I dont have much experience on it
[147.158.206.247] sad
[147.158.206.247] nvm
[60.53.35.10] mac shipped with less bloatware than windows counterparts
[147.158.206.247] indeed... most of them are useful in someway
[60.53.35.10] if u are interested in debloating mac, I might as well go and research on that topic
[147.158.206.247] sure
[60.53.35.10] but theres is one more thing:
[60.53.35.10] I dont have access to a MAC
[147.158.206.247] maybe use a VM>
[60.53.35.10] I once had a hackintosh, but that pc is wiped and no longer with me
[60.53.35.10] a VM yields pooooooooor performance
[147.158.206.247] ahhhhhhh sad
[60.53.35.10] it is UNUSABLE
[147.158.206.247] seriously
[147.158.206.247] welp nvm
[60.53.35.116] tomorrow lesson: instead of teaching them on how to debloat, also teach them on how to prevent bloatware
[60.53.35.10] yah
[147.158.206.247] yeah
[60.53.35.116] yup I woke up
[60.53.35.10] i create a slide show
[60.53.35.116] cannot sleep
[147.158.206.247] so fast
[147.158.206.247] ahh
[147.158.206.247] brain got bloated by science stuff I guess
[147.158.206.247] lol
[60.53.35.10] teach them the concept of bloatware, how to identify one, how u get them, and most importantly, HOW TO GET RID OF THEM
[60.53.35.116] okay I'm gonna spam the point for your tomorrows lesson
[60.53.35.116] remember copy down
[147.158.206.247] ahh sure
[60.53.35.116] ---start from here---
[60.53.35.116] what is bloatware? a bloat ware is those software (mostly bundied with another system/app) that you actually won't use it
[60.53.35.10] spam point haha........
[60.53.35.10] btw do u guys what to see the slideshow?
[60.53.35.116] I give it 2 types of bloatware: from system (such as microsoft store), from other apps (360 antivirus)
[147.158.206.247] SURE
[60.53.35.116] later can
[60.53.35.10] want to see*
[147.158.206.247] you can share the link here
[60.53.35.10] https://www.canva.com/design/DAE-e7MJ6OM/kRDBgATPHMD-wL0p1Cy1_w/view?utm_content=DAE-e7MJ6OM&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton
[60.53.35.10] here u go~
[60.53.35.116] hmm canva
[60.53.35.10] I get these infos from three websites talking about bloatware
[147.158.206.247] consider using figma
[60.53.35.10] gonna try that~
[60.53.35.116] wait
[60.53.35.116] figma will be a hell
[60.53.35.116] my geography report is done using figma
[60.53.35.116] 76mb in total
[147.158.206.247] STUNNING
[60.53.35.116] okay I need to get back to the point
[60.53.35.116] so now I won't say some of the exist points
[60.53.35.116] to save my time
[60.53.35.116] disadvantages of bloatware - privacy danger. sometimes bloatware may track your keyboard input or even track your screen footage, which will cause issue on your personal identification such as your email account
[60.53.35.10] whoa I didn't know that
[60.53.35.116] privacy danger 2: your photos which in your computer may got "stolen" by those bloatware
[60.53.35.10] I only know it slow downs ur PC
[147.158.206.247] especially those chinese bloatware preinstalled in chinese branded phone
[60.53.35.116] some of the bloatware may contains malware which using your computer for cryptomining
[60.53.35.116] or even DDoS other server, and you will be one of the victim of criminal activities
[147.158.206.247] like those in the russia ukraine war
[147.158.206.247] those hacker somehow remotely installed bloatware on millions of machine to help them ddos russia website
[60.53.35.116] yup
[60.53.35.10] OK ltr im gonna save and combine all these infos into my slides
[60.53.35.116] next, how to find if the app you will installed is bloatware:
[60.53.35.116] 1. Free apps but not open source: as you know free things is the most expensive one
[60.53.35.10] if u are not paying for the product, U ARE THE PRODUCT
[60.53.35.116] 2. Cracked apps, especially the one you googled for it. Some cracked apps not just bring your bloatware, also bring you malware
[60.53.35.116] 3. Trial apps
[147.158.206.247] especially those app with microtransaction
[60.53.35.116] To prevent those bloatware, be sure to read ALL BUTTONS on an installer. Many people got a lot of bloatware because they ignore the "install xxx antivirus" button which is enabled by default
[60.53.35.10] yes
[60.53.35.10] yes
[60.53.35.10] exactly
[60.53.35.10] tmr im gonna say this
[60.53.35.116] you MUST avoid this: p2p 下载器
[60.53.35.116] **show them the p2p photo**
[147.158.206.247] install xxx antivirus: for example 360防火墙
[60.53.35.116] let them know not to use this installer
[147.158.206.247] how about utorrent or bittorrent or smth
[147.158.206.247] ohh btw if you want to keep the chat history make sure not to leave the page or copy and paste the whole chat history into other place
[60.53.35.116] also, trust mainstream browser such as edge and chrome. They won't give you bloatware
[147.158.206.247] firefox
[60.53.35.116] besides, DO NOT USE sudden appeared open source apps
[60.53.35.116] like chromium
[60.53.35.116] and firefox wich suddenly appeared
[60.53.35.116] furthermore, download installer from trusted official site
[147.158.206.247] yup
[60.53.35.10] yeah
[60.53.35.10] not like cnet
[60.53.35.116] this is some of my experience on debloating
[147.158.206.247] better use package installer like homebrew or pacman or apt or smth
[60.53.35.116] ohh wait... do not use untrusted apps or apps which gave by others. I can be dangerous
[60.53.35.10] "I can be dangerous"
[60.53.35.116] windows user cannot use package installer
[60.53.35.116] it can be****
[60.53.35.10] hahaha
[147.158.206.247] choco
[60.53.35.10] OK back to the point~~
[147.158.206.247] https://chocolatey.org/
[60.53.35.116] okay those above it is the points of bloatware. Now it's my reminder time for all mcs members
[60.53.35.116] 1. choose only web app or desktop app. Do not use both
[60.53.35.116] eg. microsoft 365 and office 2016
[60.53.35.116] 2. use only one browser, create multiple profile is required
[60.53.35.116] I recommend edge for google meet user
[60.53.35.116] 3. Trust windows defender. Windows defender not bad okay?
[60.53.35.10] i have avast btw
[147.158.206.247] double protection
[60.53.35.10] studies shows that windows defender perform worse when DISCONNECTED from the internet
[147.158.206.247] I see
[60.53.35.116] ohh wait... DO NOT USE 2 ANTIVIRUS AT A SAME TIME
[60.53.35.116] they can fight each other
[60.53.35.10] yes this iss true
[147.158.206.247] windows defender think avast is malware and vice versa
[60.53.35.10] i see 360 as jin shan du ba and avast killing, blocking each other
[60.53.35.10] and*
[60.53.35.116] but if you installed your third party antivirus, windows defender will knew it and disabled itself. so don't worry if windows defender will fight with them or not
[60.53.35.116] windows defender will disable itself in this situation
[147.158.206.247] btw, English exam... I'm so afraid
[60.53.35.116] no A?
[147.158.206.247] got one girl in my class got 98 or smth
[60.53.35.10] ur english so good
[60.53.35.116] then I think your english not the best among your class
[147.158.206.247] yup
[147.158.206.247] that girl true 学霸
[147.158.206.247] good at everything
[60.53.35.10] haha
[147.158.206.247] but I guess she only know how to study only
[60.53.35.10] u challenge her to chat using pure english
[60.53.35.10] see how she react
[60.53.35.116] by chatting using english you can increase your spontaneious rate
[147.158.206.247] welp if there's any chance in the future for sure I'll do so
[60.53.35.116] especially on oral test
[147.158.206.247] indeed
[60.53.35.116] being a science student is hard mostly, the study method is more complex
[60.53.35.116] also the knowledge is adverse for us when time goes
[60.53.35.10] adverse? why?
[60.53.35.116] you won't find any flavour later
[147.158.206.247] quite useless if you don't want to become doctor or scientist
[147.158.206.247] mostly unrelated to our daily life
[60.53.35.10] thats true
[60.53.35.116] suitable study method is better than study more
[60.53.35.116] this is what I want to tell everyone. Really, find the best study method for yourself
[60.53.35.10] +1
[60.53.35.116] and also ***247 you have a good study method which can be many people's references
[147.158.206.247] nah I barely study
[147.158.206.247] simply get an A then ok alr
[147.158.206.247] I give up 内卷
[60.53.35.116] i mean your study method
[60.53.35.116] not fully means academic
[147.158.206.247] pick a useful skills and learn it
[60.53.35.116] how you study programming
[60.53.35.116] is what everyone should know
[60.53.35.10] 我个人认为it boils down to ur 兴趣
[60.53.35.116] too many passive learner
[147.158.206.247] yup self studying is the most important skill to be acquired by everyone
[60.53.35.10] 如果今天你对一个科目没有兴趣，逼你读也没有什么效果
[147.158.206.247] most people can't even realise what they love to do
[60.53.35.10] 但是如果你对某样东西真的有兴趣，你怎么样都会找得到时间和精力去学习他
[147.158.206.247] they don't have the motivation to spend time finding thier true love
[147.158.206.247] 学校把学生的时间安排的妥妥当当的，基本上剩下的空闲时间已经很少了
[60.53.35.116] 因为我们是“全职学生”
[60.53.35.116] rarely used chinese chat
[60.53.35.10] haha
[147.158.206.247] we are treated like slaves
[147.158.206.247] all these hardwork give us nothing
[147.158.206.247] we never get paid
[147.158.206.247] in fact, we even have to pay them
[147.158.206.247] to be forced to spend time learn all these useless stuff
[147.158.206.247] *learning
[147.158.206.247] which can be easily acquired through googling
[60.53.35.116] for me my study method is learning something by doing something, so this is why I don't like to listen to class. I would prefer doing notes/implement it to learn from it
[147.158.206.247] exactly the same as me
[60.53.35.10] programming also work this way
[60.53.35.116] i love doing notes because I gain knowledge by actively implement it
[60.53.35.116] yup agreed
[147.158.206.247] this is why I can chat with you guys now and leave the class alone
[60.53.35.10] thats how I learn video editing and stuff like that
[60.53.35.10]
[60.53.35.10]
[60.53.35.10]
[60.53.35.10]
[147.158.206.247] ohh wait I need to do the chat message filtering later
[147.158.206.247] yup
[60.53.35.116]
[60.53.35.116] ohh
[147.158.206.247] lots of skills nowadays can be self taught
[60.53.35.116] blank message and space messages shouldnt be sent
[147.158.206.247] yup
[147.158.206.247] school sucks a lot
[147.158.206.247] everyday we waste 8 hours sitting in the classroom
[147.158.206.247] totally a waste of life
[147.158.206.247] I would rather spend 8 hours sitting in front of my computer learning code
[60.53.35.116] and this is why I will quit school if I got retained
[147.158.206.247] school is great, but education system sucks a lot
[60.53.35.10] maybe it is becoz most ppl cant self-taught? (personal opinion)
[147.158.206.247] yup indeed
[147.158.206.247] but we are those minority
[147.158.206.247] but... we still have to get the fucking cert
[147.158.206.247] in order for us to get into university
[60.53.35.10] without cert we can even apply for university and college etc.
[60.53.35.116] i will use a year of tine to fully concentrate on what I really love, and also register for my "huge event"
[60.53.35.116] ****247 know whats that
[147.158.206.247] yup
[147.158.206.247] malaysia sucks
[60.53.35.10] u gonna migrate to SG soon?
[60.53.35.116] if I retained then I will absolutely go
[60.53.35.116] I'm not gonna waste my time anymore
[147.158.206.247] and at that time we'll have a Singaporean friend
[147.158.206.247] mari kita rakyat singapura sama sama menuju bahagia ~
[60.53.35.116] but actually I still love the calm of malaysia
[60.53.35.116] relax in malaysia
[147.158.206.247] sg ppl have a quick rythm of life
[60.53.35.116] at least what we can say is we aren't in China or India
[60.53.35.116] go see their 内卷
[147.158.206.247] a lot worse
[60.53.35.10] they have much more restriction
[60.53.35.116] I cried for them
[147.158.206.247] their life has totally no meaning
[60.53.35.116] no... they study like in a hell
[60.53.35.116] school is the hell
[147.158.206.247] yup no life alr
[147.158.206.247] our school is is very similar to hell alr
[60.53.35.116] what they need to hold is the huge pressure, which I think this is not what they can hold
[60.53.35.116] our school not that worse, but not far
[147.158.206.247] chinese way of teaching
[147.158.206.247] memorise everything and you're good to go
[60.53.35.116] in singapore I can customize the subject I want to study, or if want to follow stream also okay
[60.53.35.10] we need to learn how to search for information, not just 死记硬背
[60.53.35.116] ohh in sg malay is optional
[60.53.35.10] really？
[60.53.35.116] which is a special program for malaysian who study in sg can take malay as third language (optional)
[60.53.35.116] even if you're singapore citizen also optional
[60.53.35.116] but they recommend me to take it
[60.53.35.116] as third language
[60.53.35.10] yeah malay is quite important in Asia
[60.53.35.10] southeast asia
[147.158.206.247] I'll use english everywherr
[147.158.206.247] MALAY SUCKS
[60.53.35.10] english yyds!!
[147.158.206.247] YESSSSSS
[60.53.35.116] Singapore requires mother tongue as first language and English as second language
[147.158.206.247] Chinese also kinda yyds
[147.158.206.247] but I hate 文言文
[60.53.35.116] you can choose a third language from the 8 languages list
[60.53.35.116] which I think I will choose Malay
[60.53.35.10] it's a bit hard to understand 文言文
[147.158.206.247] indeed
[60.53.35.116] bahasa klasik
[147.158.206.247] and most importantly what's the purpose of studying ancient people's fb posts?
[147.158.206.247] aka 绯闻
[147.158.206.247] 废文
[60.53.35.116] btw is there anyone who has read the original book of moby dick?
[60.53.35.116] it's quite hard to understand about
[147.158.206.247] literature stuff
[60.53.35.116] yup
[60.53.35.116] literature sux
[147.158.206.247] 我不会欣赏

[147.158.206.247] Linux YYDS
