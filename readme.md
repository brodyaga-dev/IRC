<p align="center">A private chatroom for discussing secret stuff.</p>

## The Problem

- Almost all chatapps nowadays aren't safe enough for private communication
- There's a high risk that big tech company will take your chat data and sell them to third parties (like ads company)
- I wanna mess around with Socket.IO

## The Solution

I've made a simple yet nice-looking chat app that allows people to connect to it and chat with each other. All the chat history will not be recorded by the server and will be completely gone after users refresh their page.
